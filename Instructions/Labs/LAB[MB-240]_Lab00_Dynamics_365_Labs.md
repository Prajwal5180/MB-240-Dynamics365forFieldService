# Practice Lab - Validate lab environment

## Scenario

Worldwide Industries (WWI) provides IT and networking services to their customers. Their services range from phone system and network installations to telephoning systems and security system installations. They are going to be leveraging Dynamics 365 for Field Service for installation and servicing of these systems for their customers. You are the system implementor that has been tasked with configuring the application to support the rollout of the application. You will be adding and configuring some products that can be installed and setting up skills and characteristics that will be used as part of the implementation.

In this Module 0 lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “*alias*”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course.

**Important notice for users:** Please do not make any changes, including adding licenses or changing tenant password. Tenants are fully provisioned with all necessary licenses, environments, and applications to complete the required tenants. Instructors and students should not add any additional functionality outside of the published lab steps.
